## Oops... File Not Found: 404

Seems this page isn't around... I looked everywhere for <script>document.write(uri.mdFile)</script> ...

Should it ... be around ... <script>document.write(uri.mdPath)</script> ?

<script>document.write(`Maybe you would like to <a href="https://github.com/moltendorf/maez.red-frontend/new/master?filename=${uri.mdPath}">propose creating this page on GitHub</a>?`)</script>
